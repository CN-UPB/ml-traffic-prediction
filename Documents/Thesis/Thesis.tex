	\textbf{\textit{Abstract} -
		This master's thesis has the topic of predicting service traffic in a Network Function Virtualization scenario.
		So, predicting multiple different traffic patterns at each ingress node in a network structure.
		A problem with current algorithms for placing Virtual Network Functions in a network and scaling the services is that they can typically only react to arriving requests. 
		Replacing this reactive nature with prediction capabilities could yield results for compensating startup times, shutting down services earlier and keep services running. 
		Furthermore, the algorithm can scale the service proactively.
		Developing a machine learning model that can reliably predict new requests and what services are called by these requests is the goal of this master thesis.
		A big challenge of this thesis is the modelling of the available information as an input and the output for the neural networks.
		The second big task is the modelling and training of the machine learning models.
		The results of the machine learning model are tested against an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average model, as an already established prediction method.
		These tests show that the developed Long Short-Term Memory is not much better than an ARIMA model.
		However, both bring their advantages and disadvantages.}
