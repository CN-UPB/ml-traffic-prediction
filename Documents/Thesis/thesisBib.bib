  abstract = { Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms. },

  abstract  = {Resource Management in the network function virtualization (NFV) environment is a challenging task. The continuously varying demands of virtual network functions (VNF) call for dynamic algorithms to efficiently scale the allocated resources and meet fluctuating needs. In this context, studying the behavior of a VNF as a function of its environment helps to model its resource requirements and thus allocate them dynamically. This paper investigates the use of machine learning techniques to estimate VNFs needs in term of CPU as a function of the traffic they will process. We propose and adapt a Support Vector Regression (SVR) based approach to resolve the problem. Results show its efficiency and superiority compared to the state of the art.},

  abstract = {Today’s networks are filled with a massive and ever-growing variety of network functions that coupled with proprietary devices, which leads to network ossification and difficulty in network management and service provision. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a promising paradigm to change such situation by decoupling network functions from the underlying dedicated hardware and realizing them in the form of software, which are referred to as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Such decoupling introduces many benefits which include reduction of Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operation Expense (OPEX), improved flexibility of service provision, etc. In this paper, we intend to present a comprehensive survey on NFV, which starts from the introduction of NFV motivations. Then, we explain the main concepts of NFV in terms of terminology, standardization and history, and how NFV differs from traditional middle-box based network. After that, the standard NFV architecture is introduced using a bottom up approach, based on which the corresponding use cases and solutions are also illustrated. In addition, due to the decoupling of network functionalities and hardware, people’s attention is gradually shifted to the VNFs. Next, we provide an extensive and in-depth discussion on state-of-the-art VNF algorithms including VNF placement, scheduling, migration, chaining and multicast. Finally, to accelerate the NFV deployment and avoid pitfalls as far as possible, we survey the challenges faced by NFV and the trend for future directions. In particular, the challenges are discussed from bottom up, which include hardware design, VNF deployment, VNF life cycle control, service chaining, performance evaluation, policy enforcement, energy efficiency, reliability and security, and the future directions are discussed around the current trend towards network softwarization.},

  abstract  = {The proliferation of IP-based telecommunication networks has facilitated the decoupling of application and network layers. This kind of systems allows that Over the Top (OTT) providers deliver their content and applications directly to end users, but at the same time, the OTT applications have generated a growing impact on mobile data traffic and data revenues. In the mobile network's scope, where the Telcos offer users data plans with limited consumption, service degradation is a measure implemented in a generalized way to apply limits to the amount of data that can be transferred by the users over a period. Currently, when a user exceeds his/her established consumption limit, the Telcos, to save resources and ensure the correct performance of the network, restrict the bandwidth according to user consumption. The vast majority of approaches have not considered the consumption behavior of users to propose a set of personalized service degradation policies that benefit the Telcos but take into consideration the users' behavior. This paper proposes personalized service degradation policies, from the identification of different OTT services applying statistical analysis and deep packet inspection, and a classification of users, according to their consumption behavior and machine learning algorithms.},

We identify a weakness of LSTM networks processing continual input streams without explicitly marked sequence ends. Without resets, the internal state values may grow indefinitely and eventually cause the network to break down. Our remedy is an adaptive “forget gate” that enables an LSTM cell to learn to reset itself at appropriate times, thus releasing internal resources. We review an illustrative benchmark problem on which standard LSTM outperforms other RNN algorithms. All algorithms (including LSTM) fail to solve a continual version of that problem. LSTM with forget gates, however, easily solves it in an elegant way.},
